# Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Rust: Ensure you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. API Keys: Obtain API keys for DEX integrations, such as Jupiter and Raydium.
3. Prometheus: Install Prometheus for performance monitoring.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-agent-pro.git```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd crypto-agent-pro```


3. Build the project:

```cargo build --release```



### Configuration
1. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```
API_KEY_JUPITER=your_jupiter_api_key
API_KEY_RAYDIUM=your_rayidium_api_key
```


2. Edit the Prometheus configuration file in config/prometheus.yml to match your setup.

### Running the Application
1. Start the application:

```cargo run --release```


2. Access the web dashboard (if included) or monitor outputs in the terminal.

### Usage Guide
1.	Transaction Monitoring: View transaction updates in real-time via logs or the web interface.
2.	Swap Execution:
  •	Input the token pairs and amounts for swaps.
  •	Select a preferred DEX or allow the agent to choose the best route.
  •	Execute and track the swap.
3.	Price Tracking:
  •	Query real-time prices for tokens.
  •	View historical trends if enabled.
4.	Token Management:
  •	Add, remove, or categorize tokens in your portfolio.
  •	Monitor balances and allocations.

## Roadmap (Q1 2025)
	1.	Add support for additional DEX platforms. 
	2.	Introduce cross-chain swap capabilities.
	3.	Enhance AI-driven analytics for market predictions.
	4.	Improve UI/UX for seamless navigation.
